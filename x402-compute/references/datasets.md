# Datasets — buy fine-tuning data with a wallet

Generate a validated JSONL training dataset from a one-sentence description
plus a handful of example conversations. Pay per example in USDC. No account,
no dashboard, no human: an agent can buy its own training data.

**API base:** `https://compute.x402layer.cc`
Dashboard (wallet-session users): https://cloud.x402compute.cc/network/datasets

## The shape of the flow (read this first)

Generation takes MINUTES (a 2000-row job can take far longer), so the purchase
never waits on it:

```
POST /datasets/x402/synth                  -> 402 + quote (price, rows, model)
POST /datasets/x402/synth  (X-Payment)     -> 202 + dataset_id + claim_token   (~1s)
GET  /datasets/x402/jobs/<id>  (Bearer claim_token) -> progress, then download
```

Do NOT hold a connection waiting for the file, and do not treat the 402 as an
error: it is the price quote. Poll the status URL, or pass `webhook_url` and be
told when it is done.

## Pricing

`GET /datasets/config` (no auth) returns everything needed to quote a job:

```json
{ "synth": { "rates_per_100_usd": {"fast":0.5,"balanced":0.75,"best":1.5,"grid":0.35},
             "max_rows": 2000,
             "models": [{"id":"deepseek-v3.1","tier":"fast","in_per_m":0.25,"out_per_m":1}] } }
```

**Price = rate x rows / 100.** 500 rows on `fast` = $2.50; 2000 on `best` = $30.
The per-million-token numbers are the provider's published rates, shown for
comparison only: the buyer pays the flat per-example price, never per token.

Sizes: 50 to 2000 rows. Seeds: 5 to 20 example conversations (required — they
teach the generator the format and tone).

**Two providers.** Managed models (`model_tier` fast/balanced/best, or an exact
`model_id` from the catalog) are fastest with the best data quality. The
decentralized grid (`grid_model`, implies `provider: "grid"`) runs on our own
confidential end-to-end encrypted network, so nothing goes to an outside
provider: cheaper, slower, and if a node drops mid-job the next most
appropriate model on the network takes over automatically.

## Buying it

1. **Quote.** POST the job with no payment header. The 402 carries the standard
   x402 `accepts` array plus a `singularity` block: `quote_id`, `rows`, `tier`,
   `price_usd`, `quote_expires_at`.

```bash
curl -X POST https://compute.x402layer.cc/datasets/x402/synth \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"description":"Classify a support message as billing, technical, or account",
       "seed_examples":[ …5 to 20 {"messages":[{"role":"user",…},{"role":"assistant",…}]} … ],
       "target_rows":200, "model_tier":"fast", "network":"base"}'
```

2. **Pay.** Send the SAME body plus `quote_id`, with the signed `X-Payment`
   header. Returns **202** with `dataset_id`, `status_url`, `claim_token`,
   `price_paid_usd`, `tx_hash` (and `webhook_secret` if a webhook was given).

3. **Collect.** `GET /datasets/x402/jobs/<dataset_id>` with
   `Authorization: Bearer <claim_token>`:
   - running -> `{"status":"generating","rows_done":120,"rows_target":200}`
   - done -> `{"status":"complete","row_count":205,"download_url":"…","format":"jsonl"}`
     (presigned, 5 minutes, re-issued on every poll)
   - failed -> `{"status":"failed","refund_status":"applied"|"pending"}`

## Rules that will bite you if ignored

- **SAVE THE CLAIM TOKEN.** It is returned once, stored only as a hash, and is
  the only way to read the job or download the file. Lost token = lost dataset.
- **The payment is bound to the quoted job.** The server hashes the job
  definition; paying with a different body is refused. Send the identical body
  on both calls (a `webhook_url` may differ, it does not change the goods).
- **Quotes expire in 10 minutes**, and the price is snapshotted at quote time,
  so a rate change can never alter what is charged.
- **Validate before quoting, not after paying:** an invalid body returns 400 at
  the quote step, never a 402 you would then pay against.
- **Refunds are credits, not on-chain reversals**, and `refund_status` is read
  from the ledger rather than asserted.
- **Behind a WAF:** send a real `User-Agent`. Default library agents get 403.

## Chains

USDC on **Base** and **Solana**, USDG on **Robinhood Chain**, USDM on
**MegaETH** (18-decimal, the rest are 6). Choose with `"network"`; the
challenge returns the right asset and amount.

## Webhooks

Pass `webhook_url` (public HTTPS) at quote time and the terminal state is
POSTed to it, so polling is optional:

```
X-SGL-Signature: t=<unix>,v1=<hex hmac>
body: {"event":"dataset.synth.completed","event_id":"<order>:completed","dataset_id":…,"download_url":…}
```

Verify `HMAC-SHA256(webhook_secret, "<t>.<raw body>")` against `v1` and reject a
stale `t` (that timestamp is what makes a captured delivery non-replayable).
Redirects are not followed; only 2xx counts. Three attempts (1m, 5m, 25m) then
it stops. Delivery never affects the job, so polling is always the fallback.

## MCP

The same flow as four tools on `https://mcp.x402layer.cc/mcp`:
`list_dataset_pricing`, `request_dataset_payment`,
`create_dataset_with_payment`, `get_dataset_status`.

## What the buyer actually gets

Not raw model output. Every line is schema-checked and dropped if malformed;
near-duplicate and reworded repeats of an earlier scenario are rejected instead
of padding the count; generation is steered across a rotating set of coverage
axes so edge cases appear rather than fifty variants of one; and every row
carries the same standing instruction so the file is uniform. If the usable
floor is not reached, the fee is refunded.
